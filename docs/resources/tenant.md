# Tenant Resource

A FusionAuth Tenant is a named object that represents a discrete namespace for Users, Applications and Groups. A user is unique by email address or username within a tenant.

Tenants may be useful to support a multi-tenant application where you wish to use a single instance of FusionAuth but require the ability to have duplicate users across the tenants in your own application. In this scenario a user may exist multiple times with the same email address and different passwords across tenants.

Tenants may also be useful in a test or staging environment to allow multiple users to call APIs and create and modify users without possibility of collision.
