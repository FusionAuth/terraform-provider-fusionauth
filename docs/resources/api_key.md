# API Key

The FusionAuth APIs are primarily secured using API keys. This API can only be accessed using an API key that is set as a keyManager. In order to retrieve, update or delete an API key, an API key with equal or greater permissions must be used. A "tenant-scoped" API key can retrieve, create, update or delete an API key for the same tenant. This page describes APIs that are used to manage API keys.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "fusionauth_api_key" "example" {
  tenant_id   = "94f751c5-4883-4684-a817-6b106778edec"
  description = "my super secret key"
  key         = "super-secret-key"
  permissions_endpoints {
    endpoint = "/api/application"
    get      = true
    delete   = true
    patch    = true
    post     = true
    put      = true
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `tenant_id` - (Optional) The unique Id of the Tenant. This value is required if the key is meant to be tenant scoped. Tenant scoped keys can only be used to access users and other tenant scoped objects for the specified tenant. This value is read-only once the key is created.
* `key_id` - (Optional) The Id to use for the new Form. If not specified a secure random UUID will be generated.
* `key` - (Optional) API key string. When you create an API key the key is defaulted to a secure random value but the API key is simply a string, so you may call it super-secret-key if youâ€™d like. However a long and random value makes a good API key in that it is unique and difficult to guess.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the key.
* `ip_access_control_list_id` - (Optional) The Id of the IP Access Control List limiting access to this API key.
* `permissions_endpoints` - (Required) The unique Id of the private key downloaded from Apple and imported into Key Master that will be used to sign the client secret.
* `lambda_reconcile_id` - (Optional) Endpoint permissions for this key. Each key of the object is an endpoint, with the value being an array of the HTTP methods which can be used against the endpoint. An Empty permissions_endpoints object mean that this is a super key that authorizes this key for all the endpoints.
    - `endpoint` - (Optional)
    - `delete` - (Optional) HTTP DELETE Verb.
    - `get` - (Optional) HTTP GET Verb.
    - `patch` - (Optional) HTTP PATCH Verb
    - `post` - (Optional) HTTP POST Verb
    - `put` - (Optional) HTTP PUT Verb
