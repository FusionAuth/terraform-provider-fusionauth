# External JWT Identity Provider Resource

This is a special type of identity provider that is only used via the JWT Reconcile API. This identity provider defines the claims inside the incoming JWT and how they map to fields in the FusionAuth User object.

In order for this identity provider to use the JWT, it also needs the public key or HMAC secret that the JWT was signed with. FusionAuth will verify that the JWT is valid and has not expired. Once the JWT has been validated, FusionAuth will reconcile it to ensure that the User exists and is up-to-date.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "fusionauth_idp_external_jwt" "jwt" {
  claim_map = {
    first_name = "firstName"
    last_name  = "lastName"
    dept       = "RegistrationData"
  }
  debug                         = false
  enabled                       = true
  header_key_parameter          = "kid"
  name                          = "Acme Corp. ADFS"
  oauth2_authorization_endpoint = "https://acme.com/adfs/oauth2/authorize?client_id=cf3b00da-9551-460a-ad18-33232e6cbff0&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://acme.com/oauth2/redirect"
  oauth2_token_endpoint         = "https://acme.com/adfs/oauth2/token"
  unique_identity_claim         = "email"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `header_key_parameter` - (Required) The name header claim that identifies the public key used to verify the signature. In most cases this be kid or x5t.
* `name` - (Required) The name of the Identity Provider.

---

* `application_configuration` - (Optional) The configuration for each Application that the identity provider is enabled for.
  * `application_id` - (Optional) ID of the Application to apply this configuration to.
  * `create_registration` - (Optional) Determines if a UserRegistration is created for the User automatically or not. If a user doesnâ€™t exist in FusionAuth and logs in through an identity provider, this boolean controls whether or not FusionAuth creates a registration for the User in the Application they are logging into.
  * `enabled` - (Optional) Determines if this identity provider is enabled for the Application specified by the applicationId key.
* `claim_map` - (Optional) A map of incoming claims to User fields, User data or Registration data. The key of the map is the incoming claim name from the configured identity provider. The following are allowed values: birthDate, firstName, lastName, fullName, middleName, mobilePhone, imageUrl, timezone, UserData and RegistrationData.
* `debug` - (Optional) Determines if debug is enabled for this provider. When enabled, each time this provider is invoked to reconcile a login an Event Log will be created.
* `default_key_id` - (Optional) When configured this key will be used to verify the signature of the JWT when the header key defined by the headerKeyParameter property is not found in the JWT header. In most cases, the JWT header will contain the key identifier and this value will be used to resolve the correct public key or X.509 certificate to verify the signature. This assumes the public key or X.509 certificate has already been imported using the Key API or Key Master in the FusionAuth admin UI.
* `domains` - (Optional) An array of domains that are managed by this Identity Provider.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Determines if this provider is enabled. If it is false then it will be disabled globally.
* `idp_id` - (Optional) The ID to use for the new identity provider. If not specified a secure random UUID will be generated.
* `lambda_reconcile_id` - (Optional) The unique Id of the lambda to used during the user reconcile process to map custom claims from the external identity provider to the FusionAuth user.
* `linking_strategy` - (Optional) The linking strategy to use when creating the link between the {idp_display_name} Identity Provider and the user.
* `oauth2_authorization_endpoint` - (Optional) The authorization endpoint for this Identity Provider. This value is not utilized by FusionAuth is only provided to be returned by the Lookup Identity Provider API response. During integration you may then utilize this value to perform the browser redirect to the OAuth2 authorize endpoint.
* `oauth2_email_claim` - (Optional) The name of the claim that contains the user's email address. This will only be used when the `linking_strategy`is equal to LinkByEmail or LinkByEmailForExistingUser.
* `oauth2_email_verified_claim` - (Optional) The name of the claim that identities if the user's email address has been verified. When the `linking_strategy` is equal to LinkByEmail or LinkByEmailForExistingUser and this claim is present and the value is false a link will not be established and an error will be returned indicating a link cannot be established using an unverified email address.
* `oauth2_token_endpoint` - (Optional) The token endpoint for this Identity Provider. This value is not utilized by FusionAuth is only provided to be returned by the Lookup Identity Provider API response. During integration you may then utilize this value to complete the OAuth2 grant workflow.
* `oauth2_unique_id_claim` - (Optional) The name of the claim that contains the user's unique user Id.
* `oauth2_username_claim` - (Optional) The name of the claim that contains the user's username. This will only be used when the `linking_strategy` is equal to LinkByUsername or LinkByUsernameForExistingUser.
* `tenant_configuration` - (Optional) The configuration for each Tenant that limits the number of links a user may have for a particular identity provider.
  * `tenant_id` - (Optional) The unique Id of the tenant that this configuration applies to.
    * `limit_user_link_count_enabled` - (Optional) When enabled, the number of identity provider links a user may create is enforced by maximumLinks.
    * `limit_user_link_count_maximum_links` - (Optional) Determines if this provider is enabled. If it is false then it will be disabled globally.
* `unique_identity_claim` - (Deprecated) (Optional) The name of the claim that represents the unique identify of the User. This will generally be email or the name of the claim that provides the email address.
