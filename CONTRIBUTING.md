```

## Running tests

The tests require 3 variables set in order to run. 
```
TF_ACC=true
FA_DOMAIN=https://YOUR.fusionauth.io
FA_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

If you add these to your computer/shell environment variables then executing the tests are as simple as:
```
go test ./...
```

Alternately you can supply on the command line when executing the tests.

```
TF_ACC=true FA_DOMAIN=https://YOUR.fusionauth.io FA_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY go test ./...
```

## Running lint

If you want to head off lint errors before hitting CI you can execute them locally.

First, install golangci-lint. Instructions can be found here: https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation

Then run it:
```
golangci-lint run
```

## To uppdate the FusionAuth go-client
